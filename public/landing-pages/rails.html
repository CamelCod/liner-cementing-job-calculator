  <h1>Compress the complexity of modern web apps.</h1>
  <p>Learn just what you need to get started, then keep leveling up as you go. Ruby on Rails scales from HELLO WORLD to IPO.</p>
  <p>You’re in good company. Over the past two decades, Rails has taken countless companies to millions of users and billions in market valuations.</p>

  <p>These are just a few of the big names. There have been many hundreds of thousands of apps created with Rails since its inception.</p>
  <h2>Building it together.</h2>
  <p>Over six thousand people have contributed code to Rails, and many more have served the community through evangelism, documentation, and bug reports. Join us!</p>
  <h2>Everything you need.</h2>
  <p>Rails is a full-stack framework. It ships with all the tools needed to build amazing web apps on both the front and back end.</p>
  <p>Rendering HTML templates, updating databases, sending and receiving emails, maintaining live pages via WebSockets, enqueuing jobs for asynchronous work, storing uploads in the cloud, providing solid security protections for common attacks. Rails does it all and so much more.</p>
  <h3>Active Records make modeling easy.</h3>
  <pre><code>app/models/article.rb
class Article &lt; ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author, default: -&gt; { Current.user }
  has_many   :comments

  has_one_attached :cover_image
  has_rich_text :content, encrypted: true
  enum status: %i[ drafted published ]

  scope :recent, -&gt; { order(created_at: :desc).limit(25) }

  after_save_commit :deliver_later, if: :published?

  def byline
    "Written by #{author.name} on #{created_at.to_s(:short)}"
  end

  def deliver_later
    Article::DeliveryJob.perform_later(self)
  end
end
  </code></pre>
  <p>Databases come to life with business logic encapsulated in rich objects. Modeling associations between tables, providing callbacks when saved, encrypting sensitive data seamlessly, and expressing SQL queries beautifully.</p>
  <h3>Action Controllers handle all requests.</h3>
  <pre><code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb
class ArticlesController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @articles = Article.recent
  end

  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    fresh_when etag: @article
  end

  def create
    article = Article.create!(article_params)
    redirect_to article
  end

  private
    def article_params
      params.require(:article).permit(:title, :content)
    end
end
  </code></pre>
  <p>Controllers expose the domain model to the web, process incoming parameters, set caching headers, and render templates, responding with either HTML or JSON.</p>
  <h3>Action Views mix Ruby and HTML.</h3>
  <pre><code>app/views/articles/show.html.erb
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;%= @article.title %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;%= image_tag @article.cover_image.url %&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;%= @article.content %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;%= link_to "Edit", edit_article_path(@article) if Current.user.admin? %&gt;
  </code></pre>
  <p>Templates can use the full versatility of Ruby, excessive code is extracted into helpers, and the domain model is used directly and interwoven with the HTML.</p>
  <h3>Action Dispatch routes URLs.</h3>
  <pre><code>config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :articles do    # /articles, /articles/1
    resources :comments     # /articles/1/comments, /comments/1
  end

  root to: "articles#index" # /
end
  </code></pre>
  <p>Configure how URLs connect to the controllers using the routing domain language. Routes expose the bundle of actions that go together as a resource: index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy.</p>
  <h2>Optimized for happiness.</h2>
  <p>Rails has united and cultivated a strong tribe around a wide set of heretical thoughts about the nature of programming and programmers. Understanding these thoughts will help you understand the design of the framework.</p>
